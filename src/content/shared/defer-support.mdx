**Note:** For a GraphQL query to use `@defer` successfully, both the querying client _and_ the server it's querying must support the directive.

**Current Apollo platform support for `@defer`:**

<ExpansionPanel title="Client-side support">
  

- [Apollo Client Web](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/defer/) 3.7.0 and later (preview)
- [Apollo Kotlin](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/fetching/defer) 3.6.0 and later (experimental)


</ExpansionPanel>

<ExpansionPanel title="Server-side support">


- [Apollo Router](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing/operations/defer-support/) 1.0.0 and later (preview)
  - This support does _not_ require any of your subgraph servers to also support `@defer`.
