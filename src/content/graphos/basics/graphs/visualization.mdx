description: Enhance GraphQL schema comprehension and design with Apollo GraphOS Studio's schema visualization tool.

As your graph grows, understanding and communicating about its structure and relationships can become more difficult.
Without understanding a schema's intricacies—particularly how subgraphs relate to one another—development can become blocked or take wrong turns that need to be corrected later.

**Schema visualization** provides a clear graphical representation of your schema's structure, including types, fields, and relationships.
It can help identify potential issues in your data model, allowing for more effective schema design. Visualization enhances comprehension, facilitates discussions, and enables better decision-making throughout the development lifecycle.
