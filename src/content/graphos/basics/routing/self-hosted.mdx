Some organizations with advanced requirements need to host every part of their supergraph in their own infrastructure, _including_ the supergraph's router:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["Router"]);
  subgraphA[Locations<br/>subgraph];
  subgraphB[Reviews<br/>subgraph];
  router --- subgraphA & subgraphB;
  end;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

A supergraph with this structure is called a [self-hosted supergraph](../graphs/#self-hosted-supergraphs). Here are some reasons why an enterprise organization might need to use self-hosted routing instead of [cloud routing](./cloud/) (where Apollo hosts your router for you):

- **Compliance.** All of your supergraph's components must be hosted in a particular region to adhere to compliance requirements.
- **Performance.** You need to minimize latency between your router and subgraphs by enabling them to communicate _without_ traversing the public internet (e.g., by hosting all components in a VPC).
- **Customization.** You need to configure your router's behavior beyond what's currently possible with [cloud routing](./cloud-configuration/).

With the exception of Apollo-managed routing, self-hosted supergraphs benefit from all of the same GraphOS features as cloud supergraphs (metrics reporting, schema checks, the Explorer, and so on).
