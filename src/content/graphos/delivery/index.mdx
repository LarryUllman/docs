description: Ensure streamlined, error-free schema development using the GraphOS suite of schema development tools

GraphOS provides schema development tools to foster collaboration and efficiently deploy changes to your supergraph schema. These tools fall into two main categories:

- **Schema governance** tools let you manage, validate, and enforce consistency standards in your supergraph schema to ensure reliability and compatibility across different services and teams.
- **Schema delivery** tools let you integrate schema publication seamlessly into your DevOps workflows.

## Schema governance

GraphOS provides the following schema governance tools:

- [Schema checks](./schema-checks) help identify breaking changes before you make them and help determine when a potentially dangerous change is, in fact, safe.
- [Schema linting](./schema-linter) ensures a consistent, well-formed schemas across all your services. Automated linting lowers maintenance overheads and improves developer productivity. Schema linting can run as part of schema checks in GraphOS Studio and as one-offs via the Rover CLI.

## Schema delivery

Schema delivery refers to the process of making your supergraph schema available to clients. GraphOS requires you to [publish schema changes using the Rover CLI](./publication) to do so. Publication happens via a CLI command so you can readily integrate it into your continuous delivery pipeline.

To incorporate other important aspects of your supergraph configuration, such as your router configuration or federation version, GraphOS uses the concept of [**launches**](./launches). Schema publications trigger launches, and you can monitor them from the Launches page in GraphOS Studio.

### Contracts

GraphOS **contracts** are an enterprise feature that let you deliver _different_ subsets of your supergraph to different consumers. Contracts rely on `@tags` across various subgraph schemas to denote which types and fields are accessible to different consumers. Check out the [contract documentation](./contracts) for more information.

## Client operation validation

In addition to the governance and delivery tools for schema developers, Apollo provides a CLI command for app developers to confirm that GraphQL operations in a client application are compatible with the published schema. Refer to the [Validating client operations page](/rover/validating-client-operations) for more information.
