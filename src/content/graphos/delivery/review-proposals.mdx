## Review proposal

You can review different aspects of a proposal from its three non-editor tabs:

- Overview
- Changes
- Schema Reference

You can also provide commentary on changes from the **Changes** tab.

### Overview

- A proposal's **Overview** tab is where you can:
  - View and edit a proposal's description by clicking the pencil icon on the **README**.
  - View the proposal's status
  - Monitor changes to the proposal over time
  - Select and manage reviewers

### Changes

A proposal's **Changes** tab gives you a summary and detailed view of the schema changes that make up a proposal.

#### Add comments

In the panel that appears, you can write a comment for that line.

A blue tab shows the number of comments a particular line has.

Comments also appear on the proposal's overview tab.

### Schema Reference

The **Schema Reference** tab lets see the entire supergraph schema reference with the proposal's changes applied.
