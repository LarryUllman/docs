description: Fine-tune GraphQL the schema proposal process by configuring permissions, default reviewers, approval requirements, and schema checks with GraphOS.

<GraphOSEnterpriseRequired />

[Org and graph admins](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) can configure the following aspects of schema proposals:

- Which [roles can create and edit proposals](#configure-permissions-and-approvals)
- Which team members are [default reviewers](#default-reviewers)
- The [minimum number of approvals](#required-approvals) required for a proposal to achieve [**Approved** stage](./schema-proposals#proposal-stages)
- Whether and how [schema checks incorporate proposals](#configure-schema-checks)
- [Coming soon] Which actions in the proposals process trigger [email notifications](#configure-notifications) and to whom

<Note>

Schema proposal configurations are on a per-graph&mdash;not per-organization&mdash;basis.

</Note>

## Configure permissions and approvals

[Permissions](/graphos/org/members) for proposal actions are set at the graph level with the following defaults:

|                      | Create | Edit | View | Comment | Suggest changes | Approve |
| ------------------   | ------ | ---- | ---- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Org / Graph Admin    | ✔️     | ✔️   | ✔️   | ✔️      | ✔️      | ✔️      |
| Contributor          | ✔️     | ✔️   | ✔️   | ✔️      | ✔️      | ✔️      |
| Documenter           | ✔️     | ✔️   | ✔️   | ✔️      | ✔️      | ✔️      |
| Observer             | ✔️     | ✔️   | ✔️   | ✔️      | ✔️      | ✔️      |
| Consumer             | ❌     | ❌   | ✔️   | ✔️      | ✔️      | ✔️      |
| Billing Admin        | ❌     | ❌   | ❌   | ❌      | ❌      | ❌      |


[Org and graph admins](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) can configure which roles can _create_ and _edit_ proposals. Permissions for other proposal actions are not configurable. Permissions and other configurations are available on a graph's **Settings** page in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content).

Refer to the table below for default and valid values.

### Configuration reference

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Configuration/ <br/> Default value</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Valid values</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>

##### Permissions

Default: `Observers`

</td>

<td>

The _minimum_ [role](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) required to create and edit proposals.

<br/>

`Observers` is the least restrictive setting and `Admins` the most restrictive.
The `Observers` default means all organization members except Consumers and Billing Admins can create and edit proposals.
If you select `Admins`, only org and graph admins can create and edit proposals.

</td>

<td>

`Admins`, `Contributors`, `Documentors`, and `Observers`

</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>

##### Default reviewers

Default: `None`

</td>
<td>

The team members automatically marked as reviewers once a proposal's stage becomes [**Open for feedback**](./schema-proposals#proposal-stages).

</td>

<td>

Any member of your organization can be a default reviewer except for [billing admins](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles)

</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### Required approvals

Default: `3`

</td>
<td>

The minimum number of approvals a proposal must receive for its stage to become [**Approved**](./schema-proposals#proposal-stages).

</td>

<td>

1 - 6

</td>

</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<Note>

Changing the number of required approvals updates the stage of existing proposals that aren't [**Closed** or **Implemented**](./propose-changes#change-proposal-stage) based on whether their current number of approvals meets the new number of required approvals.

</Note>

## Configure schema checks

You can configure [schema checks](./schema-checks) to include a **Proposals** task that checks whether the changes a check is running on have matching and approved schema proposals.

<img
  src="../img/schema-proposals/proposal-check-settings.jpg"
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Schema proposals settings in Studio"
/>

By default, the severity of this task is **Off**. You can select from the following severity levels:

- With the severity set to **Off**, the proposals task isn't part of the checks that changes must pass for the check to succeed.
- Setting the severity to **Error** means the proposals task fails when the change being checked isn't included in approved proposals.
- Setting the severity to **Warning** means the proposals tasks can still pass even when the change being checked isn't included in approved proposals. However, warnings appear in the check run.

Integrating schema proposals into schema checks is a key part of [proposal process](./schema-proposals#proposal-process).
See the [Implement approved proposals](./implement-proposals) article for more information on how to use schema checks as part of your proposal process.
