<GraphOSEnterpriseRequired />

[Org and graph admins](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) can configure the following aspects of schema proposals:

- Which [roles](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) can create and edit proposals
- Which team members are default reviewers
- The minimum number of approvals required for a proposal to be approved
- How schema checks incorporate proposals
- [Coming soon] Which events in the proposals workflow trigger email notifications and to whom

<Note>

Schema proposal configurations are on a per-graph&mdash;not per-organization&mdash;basis.

## Configure permissions and approvals

[Permissions](/graphos/org/members) for proposal actions are set at the graph level with the following defaults:

|                      | Create | Edit | View | Comment | Suggest changes | Approve |
| ------------------   | ------ | ---- | ---- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Org / Graph Admin    | ✔️     | ✔️   | ✔️   | ✔️      | ✔️      | ✔️      |
| Contributor          | ✔️     | ✔️   | ✔️   | ✔️      | ✔️      | ✔️      |
| Documenter           | ✔️     | ✔️   | ✔️   | ✔️      | ✔️      | ✔️      |
| Observer             | ✔️     | ✔️   | ✔️   | ✔️      | ✔️      | ✔️      |
| Consumer             | ❌     | ❌   | ✔️   | ✔️      | ✔️      | ✔️      |
| Billing Admin        | ❌     | ❌   | ❌   | ❌      | ❌      | ❌      |


[Org and graph admins](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) can configure which roles can _create_ and _edit_ proposals and other aspects of the proposal process from a graph's **Settings** page in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content).

Refer to the table below for configurations and default and valid values.

### Configuration reference

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Configuration/ <br/> Default value</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Valid values</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>

##### Permissions

Default: `Observers`

</td>

<td>

The _minimum_ [role](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) required to create and edit proposals.

<br/>

`Admins` is the most restrictive setting and observers the least.
If you select `Admins`, only org and graph admins can create and edit proposals.
If you select `Observers`, all organization members except Consumers and Billing Admins can create and edit proposals.

</td>

<td>

`Admins`, `Contributors`, `Documentors`, and `Observers`

</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>

##### Default reviewers

Default: `None`

</td>
<td>

The team members automatically marked as reviewers once a proposal's status becomes **Open for feedback**.

</td>

<td>

Any member of your organization can be a default reviewer except for [billing admins](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles)

</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### Required approvals

Default: `3`

</td>
<td>

The minimum number of approvals a proposal must receive for its status to become **Approved**.

</td>

<td>

1 - 6

</td>

</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<Note>

Changing the number of required approvals updates the status of existing proposals that aren't [**Closed** or **Implemented**](./propose-changes#change-proposal-status) based on whether their current number of approvals meets the new number of required approvals.

</Note>

## Configure schema checks

You can configure [schema checks](./schema-checks) to include a **Proposals** task that checks whether the changes a check is running on have matching and approved schema proposals.

<img
  src="../img/schema-proposals/proposal-check-settings.jpg"
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Schema proposals settings in Studio"
/>

By default, the severity of this task is **Off**. You can select from the following severity levels:

- With the severity set to **Off**, the proposals task isn't in list of tasks a check must pass for the check to succeed.
- Setting the severity to **Error** means the proposals task fails when the change being checked isn't included in approved proposals.
- Setting the severity to **Warning** means the proposals tasks can still pass even when the change being checked isn't included in approved proposals. However, warnings appear in the check run.

Integrating schema proposals into schema checks is a key part of the [proposal workflow](./schema-proposals#proposal-workflow). See the [Implement approved proposals](./implement-proposals) article for more information on how to use schema checks as part of your proposal workflow.
