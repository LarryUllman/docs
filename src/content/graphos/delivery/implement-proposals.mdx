## Reading proposal subgraphs with Rover

Subgraph schemas can be pulled from proposals using rover subgraph fetch the same way as pulling subgraph schemas from a variant, with the proposal's id taking the place of the variant name. The proposal's id is always prefixed with p- followed by a number, and can be found in the URL of a proposal.

An example is rover subgraph fetch my-graph@p-101 --name subgraph

Pushing to a proposal via rover subgraph publish isn't supported.

## Validating changes

When a schema published to the proposal's source-variant contains changes that are in an open proposal, the corresponding [launch](./launches) appears in the proposal's activity log.

When an open proposal's changes have been fully implemented, its status changes to **Implemented**. Multiple launches can contribute to a proposal being fully implemented.

Implemented proposals are no longer editable.

<Note>

Proposals in draft mode can't receive the **Implemented** status, even when all changes are incorporated into launmches. A draft proposal's status automatically switches to Implemented once its status is changed to **Open for feedback**.
