When a schema published to the proposal's source-variant contains changes that are in an open proposal, the corresponding [launch](./launches) appears in the proposal's activity log.

When an open proposal's changes have been fully implemented, its status changes to **Implemented**. Multiple launches can contribute to a proposal being fully implemented.

Implemented proposals are no longer editable.

<Note>

Proposals in draft mode can't receive the **Implemented** status, even when all changes are incorporated into launmches. A draft proposal's status automatically switches to Implemented once its status is changed to **Open for feedback**.
