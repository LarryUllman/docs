### Scripting

Similar to tools like Postman, the Explorer can run custom **preflight scripts** before each GraphQL operation.
In general, the main purpose of scripting is to populate environment variables that can be used as header values or graphql variables.
Scripts can also be useful for debugging purposes.

There are two places in the Explorer to write these scripts:

#### Preflight Script

- It may be helpful to think of this as the global or parent preflight script,
  since as long as the feature is turned on in the settings it will always execute before any other script or operation
- This script is identical for every team member that uses the Explorer with a particular variant. Global preflight scripts are especially useful for managing authentication flows like OAuth, for example by refreshing an access token.
- The global preflight script applies to a _single variant_ of a particular graph, so you can define different ones for each of your graph's environments.

#### Operation Scripts

- Each operation in an [Operation collection](./operation-collections/) can define a script which executes before the operation runs.
- Operation Scripts have the same capabilities as the preflight script, the main differences are:
  - There can be as many scripts as there are saved operations
  - The order in which they execute
  - The access controls for viewing and editing are slightly different (need to ask what's different exactly)

#### ⚠️ Important considerations for preflight scripts

- All team members with access to a variant can _view_ that variant's preflight script.
- For [protected variants](../graphs/studio-features/#protected-variants-enterprise-only), only organization members with the [`Graph Admin` role](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) can _create or edit_ a variant's preflight script.
  - For _non_-protected variants, members with the `Contributor` role can also modify the preflight script.
- Preflight scripts are stored in the Apollo cloud in plaintext.
  - **Do not include secret credentials in preflight scripts!** Instead, team members can provide their individual credentials in the Explorer via [environment variables](#environment-variables).
- Team members can [disable](#disabling-preflight-scripts) the execution of a preflight script.
- Scripts can use the `explorer.runOperation` method to execute other saved operations which may also define their own scripts
  creating a chain of script & operation execution.

#### Creating a preflight script

To create a preflight script:

1. [Open Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/) and then open the Explorer for the graph and variant you want to create a script for.

2. Open the Explorer's Settings tab and scroll down to the **Preflight script** section:

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/preflight-script.jpg"
     alt="Preflight script settings in the Explorer"
     width="500"
   />

3. Click **Add script**. The following dialog appears:

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/preflight-script-edit.jpg"
     alt="Editing preflight scripts in the Explorer"
     width="600"
   />

4. Click **Show snippets** to display a list of common helpful actions you can perform from your preflight script (such as sending HTTP requests and interacting with Explorer environment variables).

5. Develop your script in the **Script editor** panel. As you develop, you can click **Test script** to test its execution. Console messages are printed in the **Console output** panel.

6. When your script is ready, click **Save**. Studio stores your script.

You're done! After you save your script, it's automatically loaded for any team member that uses the Explorer with the associated variant.

#### Preflight script API reference

These symbols are available within the scope of a preflight script. Snippets for each are available via the **Show snippets** link in the preflight script dialog.

      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td>

##### `explorer.environment.get`

`(key: string) => Readonly`

</td>
<td>

Function that returns the current value of the environment variable with the specified `key`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `explorer.environment.set`

`(key: string, value: JSONValue) => void`

</td>
<td>

Function that sets a new value for the environment variable with the specified `key`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `explorer.fetch`

`(href: string, options?: { method?: string, body?: string | null, headers?: Record<string, string>, credentials: 'include' | 'omit' | 'same-origin' }) => Promise<{ code: number, body: string, json: () => any }>`

</td>
<td>

Function for making HTTP requests to external services from within a preflight script.

Network requests are initiated from an origin of `https://preflight-request.apollographql.com`, please ensure the appropriate CORS headers are sent for those requests.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `explorer.runOperation`

`(options: { scope?: 'personal' | 'shared' | 'sandbox'; graphRef?: string | null; collectionName: string; operationName: string; headers?: Record<string, string>; variables?: JSONObject; }) => Promise<{ result: ExecutionResult<JSONObject> | undefined; code: number; }>`

</td>
<td>

Function for executing other saved operations. If the target operation has defined its own script, it will run before its operation.

Note about parameters:

- If `scope` is `undefined`, `graphRef` is required
- If `graphRef` is `undefined`, `scope` is required

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `explorer.prompt`

`(msg: string, defaultResponse?: string) => Promise<string | null>`

</td>
<td>

Function that prompts the user for input and returns the value in a promise. If the user cancels the prompt, the promise resolves to `null`.

The prompt supports Markdown rendering of the `msg` parameter.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `explorer.request.body`

`{ query: string; variables: { [key in string]?: JSONValue } | null; operationName: string | undefined; }`

</td>
<td>

The body of the `POST` request that's sent to the configured GraphQL endpoint for the current operation.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `explorer.CryptoJS`

</td>
<td>

This exposes the `crypto-js` package for use within your preflight script. For available functions, [see the documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js).

#### Disabling preflight scripts

By default, a variant's preflight script runs automatically before every GraphQL operation that's executed in the Explorer. Team members can temporarily disable the script from the **Preflight script** section of the Settings tab. To do so, toggle the switch to **OFF**:

  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/preflight-script-disable.jpg"
  alt="Disabling preflight scripts in the Explorer"
  width="500"
/>

#### Creating an operation script:

Operation scripts are only available on operations that are saved in a [collection](./operation-collections/).

1. Select an operation from the Operation Collections menu

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/select-operation.png"
     alt="Selecting an operation"
     width="400"
   />

2. Select the Script tab and press the + Add Script button

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/script-tab-new.png"
     alt="Adding a new operation script"
     width="500"
   />

3. The operation script editor modal is very similar to the preflight script modal.

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/op-script-modal.png"
     alt="Editing operation scripts in the Explorer"
     width="600"
   />

For guidance on using this modal, refer to the section "Creating a Preflight Script".

#### Handlebars in the Variables Pane

It is possible to use handlebars to evaluate environment variables. Consider the following setup:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/handlebars-1.png"
  alt="Using handlebars in the variables pane"

/>

However you may need to retrieve data from an operation with a script to correctly set the variable.

/>
