title: Connecting and authenticating with the Explorer
---

The Explorer automatically attempts to connect to your GraphQL server at the URL specified in its Settings tab.

> When you use the Explorer with a [cloud supergraph](../graphs/overview/#cloud-supergraphs), the endpoint URL is always the URL of your current variant's GraphOS-managed router.

Depending on your GraphQL server's settings, you might need to configure the Explorer's connection to handle CORS requirements or authentication.

## CORS policies

Requests from the Explorer go straight from your browser to your GraphQL server, so your endpoint will see requests coming from the `https://studio.apollographql.com` domain.

It's common for public endpoints to have [CORS policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) that restrict which domains can query them. If your endpoint has CORS protections enabled, you probably need to safelist `https://studio.apollographql.com` in your CORS policy to use the Explorer.

To do so, include the following header(s) in your server's responses:

```bash
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://studio.apollographql.com

# Include this one only if your server also authenticates via cookies.
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

> If you can't change your CORS policy, you might be able to create a proxy for your endpoint and point the Explorer to the proxy instead. CORS policies are enforced by browsers, and the proxy won't have the same issues communicating to your endpoint.

## Authentication

The Explorer currently enables you to authenticate via [request headers](#request-headers), [cookies](#cookies), and [preflight scripts](#preflight-scripts).

> If your graph has authentication requirements that aren't covered by these options, please contact **support@apollographql.com** with questions or feedback.

### Request headers

The bottom panel of the Explorer includes a Headers tab where you can set headers that are included in your operation's HTTP request.

Headers can include the values of [environment variables](#environment-variables), which are specified with double curly braces as shown:

  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/explorer-headers.jpg"
  alt="Setting Explorer headers with environment variables"
  width="500"
/>

### Cookies

If your server uses cookies to authenticate, you can configure your endpoint to share those cookies with `https://studio.apollographql.com`.

To set this up, your [cookie's value must contain `SameSite=None; Secure`](https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site). Additionally, these CORS headers must be present in your server's response to Studio:

```bash
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://studio.apollographql.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

Once configured, requests sent from `https://studio.apollographql.com` will carry the cookies from your domain when you run queries with the Explorer. If you're logged in on your domain, requests from the Explorer will also be logged in. If you log out on your domain and the cookie is removed, requests from the Explorer will be logged out.

### Environment variables --todo: make own page, or move to scripting

The Explorer's Settings tab includes a section for providing Environment Variables. Here, you can provide sensitive information that you can then include in header values or [preflight scripts](#preflight-scripts). This enables you to share operations (including headers) with other team members _without_ exposing sensitive data.

For example, you can define a `token` environment variable like so:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/explorer-environment-variables.jpg"
  alt="Setting Explorer environment variables"
  width="300"
/>

You can then include that environment variable in header values with double curly braces, as shown:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/explorer-use-environment-variable.jpg"
  alt="Setting Explorer headers with environment variables"
  width="400"
/>

If you share this operation with team members, your value for `token` is _not_ shared, and other users can provide their own value.
