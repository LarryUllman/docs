---

The pages below provide detail on each of the supergraph best practices outlines in the [Supergraph Architecture Framework (SAF)](/graphos/enterprise/supergraph-architecture-framework).
Review them to get further understanding of why each of them are a best practice and how to practically implement them in your organization.

## Operational Excellence

<Grid>
  <GridItem title={"Schema Design"} path="operational-excellence/schema-design">
    A successful schema has broad utility, meets front-end requirements, and support safe and 
    continuous evolution as product requirements and upstream systems change.
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem title={"Org Structure"} path="best-practices-schema-design">
    Institutional support is crucial for the success of your supergraph. This support includes training for teams to 
    embed or cultivate GraphQL expertise, as well as the designation of a GraphQL stewardship group to review best practices and processes. 
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem title={"Scaling your Supergraph"} path="best-practices-schema-design">
    Apollo Federation allows you to create independent, modular GraphQL services, which can then be served using Apollo
    Router. The router acts as a graph gateway, allowing you to compose these services into a single, unified graph that 
    can be accessed by clients.
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem title={"Enforcing Best Practices"} path="best-practices-schema-design">
    In addition to enforcing subgraph standards and best practices, it is important to help supergraph contributors 
    make effective use of the platform through tooling and documentation.
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem title={"Supergraph Health"} path="best-practices-schema-design">
    By documenting the process for type and field migration, as well as workflows for 
    field deprecation and removal, teams can ensure that the supergraph remains up-to-date as new requirements arise.
