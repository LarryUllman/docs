</Tip>

Your supergraph schema is a critical point of collaboration between frontend and backend, as well as between teams across your organization. A successful schema has broad utility, meets front-end requirements, and support safe and continuous evolution as product requirements and upstream systems change. Apolloâ€™s customers achieve lasting success when they implement processes that encourage these best practices.

- [BP-2: Design schema based on end-user requirements](end-user-requirements)
- [BP-5 Design schema as an abstraction layer on top of data sources](abstraction-layer)

## Supergraph Architecture Framework (SAF)
The best practices outlined in this section are part of the [Supergraph Architecture Framework (SAF)](/graphos/enterprise/supergraph-architecture-framework). The SAF provides a collection of best practices in supergraph development. 
It serves as a roadmap for architecture and platform teams, guiding your organization toward an optimal supergraph implementation.

Contact your Apollo customer success team to complete the SAF assessment. If you're just getting started with Apollo, don't hesitate to get in touch.
